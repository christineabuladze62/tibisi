      All About Me
<p style="  max-width: 750px; 
  white-space: normal; ">
      I was born on April 26, 2010, and I am currently a tenth-grade student. My interest in technology started back in seventh grade, and since then, I have been passionate about learning new things in this field. I have participated in various projects and activities that helped me grow my skills and understanding.
    </p>
    <p style="  max-width: 750px; 
  white-space: normal; ">
        I have experience working on STEM projects, including 3D modeling and robotics. I am also a member of the Pascal STEAM Community, where I completed several courses and gained valuable knowledge. One of my favorite experiences was participating in the Moon Camp project, organized by NASA and ESA, where I worked closely with a team to create a 3D model for space exploration.
    </p>
    <p style="  max-width: 750px; 
  white-space: normal; "> Besides technology, I enjoy working on humanitarian projects and am always eager to apply what I learn to help others. I believe that continuous learning and teamwork are key to achieving great things, and I’m excited about the future opportunities ahead of me.
</p>
<p style="  max-width: 750px; 
  white-space: normal; ">  I am also passionate about literature and creative writing, which helps me think critically and express my ideas clearly. Being involved in different clubs and activities has taught me the importance of communication and leadership skills, which I strive to improve every day.
  </p>
  <p style="  max-width: 750px; 
  white-space: normal; "> In my free time, I like exploring new technologies and experimenting with coding projects. These experiences motivate me to keep growing and push the boundaries of what I can create. I look forward to using my skills to make a positive impact in the world.
